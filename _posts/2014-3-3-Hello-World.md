title: Life as it happens!
---

Experience the life as it happens or you may miss it! In life, either taught or by nature, we, humans, act same. We dream, expect, anticipate, act, experience. As all these things happen, life also happens. We always see the world from first person view but life moves on from third person view. It continues no matter what we experience. No matter what we dream. That is why I am writing this post; just to acknowledge that I am a simple humanbeing with dreams and desires but I need to know that I only play my part in my world as life happens. Surrender to true meaning; we do our best and life happens, whether it is good or bad for you does not your responsibility.
