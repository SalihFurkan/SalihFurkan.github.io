# Research Projects & Publications

My research spans machine learning, computer vision, and their applications in medical imaging and video processing. Below are some of my key projects and publications.

## Featured Projects

### Neural Network Solutions for Medical Imaging
Developed deep learning approaches for automated classification of medical X-ray images, specifically focusing on Cervical Vertebrae Maturation (CVM) stages.

**Key Achievements:**
- Created a fully automated system for determining CVM stages using custom CNN architectures
- Designed novel directional filters to highlight features in X-ray images
- Achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracy on limited medical datasets

### Input Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent (INSGD)
Invented a novel optimization algorithm named "INSGD" to improve the performance of CNN models on imbalanced and insufficient datasets.

**Key Features:**
- Enhanced convergence compared to traditional SGD
- Improved performance on class-imbalanced data
- Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (2024)

### Motion Estimation for Video Encoding
Developed specialized CNN models for motion estimation and optical flow detection to enhance video codec performance.

**Contributions:**
- Designed custom neural network architectures for efficient motion estimation
- Implemented C++ algorithms for production video processing systems
- Improved compression efficiency while maintaining visual quality

### AggregateNet for Medical Image Classification
Designed a deep learning model for automated classification of medical images with limited training data.

**Impact:**
- Published in Orthodontics & Craniofacial Research
- Demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional methods
- Created an end-to-end solution applicable in clinical settings
